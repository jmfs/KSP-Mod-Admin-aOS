KSP Mod Admin aOS by Bastian Heinrich

KSP Mod Admin is a mod managing tool for KSP on any OS.
It provides simple and fast mod managing and keeps your mod collection up to date.

OK, no rocket science but it speed up the installation, updating or removal of mods and so you will have more time to do rocket science :D.
It also let you choose what parts of the mod should be installed.
